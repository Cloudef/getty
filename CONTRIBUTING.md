# Contributing to Getty

Contributions to Getty are very welcome! This document provides some guidelines
and information to help you get started.

## First Steps

If you're new to Getty, the best place to get started is
[`src/ser/with/`](src/ser/with/). The directory contains files for every data
type Getty knows how to serialize: booleans, arrays, `std.ArrayList`, it's all
in there!

I'm planning on supporting most of the standard library types, so a great way
to start contributing to Getty is by finding a data type in `std` that you like
and creating a file for it!

If you have any questions or don't know what to do, feel free to create an
issue for your data type and I'll help you out! The documentation for Getty is
currently a work-in-progress so please don't hesitate to ask for help.
